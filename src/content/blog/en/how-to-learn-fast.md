## The one Million-dollar question

This is the million-dollar, or even more, question that everyone tries to answer and claim the prize. If you're skeptical like me, you know there is no one-size-fits-all answer. However, in the following text, I'll try to teach you some concepts that I've learned, which have helped me acquire new knowledge.

## Chunks

I figured out very soon that when we start acquiring knowledge, our brain attempts to reuse things it has learned to help us understand new information. It might seem very obvious, but you need to keep that in mind to reap the benefits of this process. So basically, it creates some chunks of information that it can correlate with new things you're learning. For example, if you're trying to acquire a new programming language, the basic command chunk is already there, and you naturally start to compare its similarities with what you already know.

I provided the most basic example with some obvious instances, but it applies to whatever we have learned. For instance, if you've learned the basics of sales or marketing, the next time you try to create a product, you'll probably think more about "how can I sell this?" and apply some techniques you've learned, compared to the past.
